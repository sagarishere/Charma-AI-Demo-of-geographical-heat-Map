Creates a geopgraphic heat map of the city of Toronto using shape files. 

## Dataset

The dataset is a random list of neighbourhoods in Toronto, which will serve to represent the overall ROI score for the neighbourhood selection for charger installation of Toronto. 

## Shape Files

Shape files are used to draw the map of the city of Toronto. These can be obtained from the [Neighbourhoods dataset of The City of Toronto Open Data Initiative](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/)

For convenience, the shape files from that link have been included in this repository, under the forAnalysis folder.
